"""
 You are given a non-empty list of integers (X).
For this task, you should return a list
consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list.
To do so you will need to remove all unique elements
(elements which are contained in a given list only once).
When solving this task, do not change the order of the list
Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3 ]1 and 3 non-unique elements
and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].
